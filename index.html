<p1>Tobacco is smoked in hookahs in many villages as per traditional customs. <br>Smoking tobacco-molasses is now becoming popular among the youth in India. <br>There are several chain clubs, bars and coffee shops in India offering a wider variety of mu‘assels,<br> including non-tobacco versions. <br>Hookah was recently banned in Bangalore.</p1><br>

<h3>Middle East</h3>
<p3>In the Arab world and the Middle East, people smoke waterpipes as part of their culture and traditions. Local names of waterpipe in the Middle East are, argila, čelam/čelīm, ḡalyān or ghalyan, ḥoqqa, nafas, nargile, and shisha.<br>

<br>Social smoking is done with a single or double hose hookah, and sometimes even triple or quadruple hose hookahs are used at parties or small get-togethers. When the smoker is finished, s/he either places the hose back on the table, signifying that it is available, or hands it from one user to the next, folded back on itself so that the mouthpiece is not pointing at the recipient.</p3><br>

<br><br><br><h4>Syria</h4>
<p4>Although perceived to be an important cultural feature of Syria (see Smoking in Syria), <br>narghile had declined in popularity during most of the twentieth century and was used mostly by older men. <br>Similar to other Middle Eastern countries, its use increased dramatically during the 1990s, <br>particularly among youth and young adults.</p4><br>
